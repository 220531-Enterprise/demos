# BlackRock Interview Questions
*The following questions are reported back from several different assocaites in interviews with [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual).*

<br>

- When would you use an array list vs set? 

- Pull up an IDE and write this method: I give you a string, tell me how many words in that string. 

- Take that previous string and give me a Map of the word and the number of times the word appears in the string (Study up on maps) 

- Time complexities of sort, add/remove for different data structures 

- What are the best ways to sort large sets of data vs smaller ones, and when to use certain types of collections? 

- Time complexity of `for` and **nested** `for loops`? 

- Whatâ€™s the difference between an immutable and mutable object? 

- Write a method to determine whether a String is a palindrome.

- Not too many questions outside of core Java 

- Who are you? 

- Why Tech? 

- Why Revature? 

- What is OOP? 

- Why did you leave your previous job? 

- Do you prefer front or backend? 

- Name a challenge you overcame 

- How did you handle the stress of Revature?  

- If I asked your former managers, what would they say is your biggest weakness? 

- What frustrates you? 

- What do you do for fun? 

- Build a method to calculate the prime numbers between 1 and 100. 

- Can you do the above but in just one line? Hint use Streams and java.math.BigInteger.isProbablePrime() 

- How do you change file permissions in Linux? 

- How do you move around in the Linux Terminal and show files? 

- How would you troubleshoot a crashed server? 

- How would you troubleshoot 100% cpu usage? 

- Challenge: *you can use IDE and Google in this one*: 
  1. Read from a log file line by line, parsing the string and counting each webpage's visits 
  2. Store the above in a `HashMap` 
  3. Print from the hashmap a descending list of the most visited files (had to make a `Comparator` for the HashMap)
