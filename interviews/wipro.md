# Wipro Interview Prep
*Below are the criteria upon which Wipro will evaluate.  See coding problems at the bottom.  **The biggest thing that Wipro looks for is confidence and communication.  You must speak through your thought process when coding in front of them**:*

<br>

- Java 8 Basics
  - Basics/Fundamentals: Be confident and adept in all Java basics (Week 1 & 3)
  - :star: Collections: Maps, Set, `equals()` and `hashCode()` contracts - *Wipro asks a lot of questions about the different data structures*
  - Multithreading: What are the multiple ways to create a thread in Java?
  - **How does Java verify that an object is unique? How does a Set check uniqueness?

<br>

- SQL
  - Be able to make an `INNER JOIN` from two tables
  - Purpose of `UNION`
  - Purpose of Prepared Statements (be able to cite that SQL Injection is a recognized threat to Web services as stated by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection))

<br>

- Spring: *rarely evaluates on this in depth*

<br>

- REST API - What makes an API RESTful?

<br>

- "Tell me about yourself" - [How to answer well](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/interview-question-tell-me-about-yourself)

<br>

- Soft Skills: Evalutated for...
  -  Communication & Articulation
  -  Attitude
  -  Coachability/Adaptability
  -  How well does the candidate listen 
 
 <br>

- Basic Javascript - Datatypes, Strings & Boolean Manipulation

<br>

- [MVC: Model View Controller pattern](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc)
 
 <br>
 
 ## Coding Problems:
 *Below I've outlined common tehcnical interview questions along with a resource on how to do it:*
 
 > *While you are coding infront of them, Wipro will look for you to say your thought process outloud. **DO NOT** code in silence.  They also welcome questions about the code.  They are looking for good listeners who are creative and communicative in their problem solving process - rely on your own knowledge and practice as well as your interviewer's.  Don't be afraid to ask them questions.*

- Evaluate JavaScript expressions such as: `console.log(1 + "2" + "2");`

- Create a method to evaluate a SQL expression using JDBC.

- Wipro doesn't follow the normal panel style "question/answer". They will focus on Collections at some point for sure, however, they will test candidates on whatever they say in their "About me" at the beginning, especially if they say they are good at it.
    - For example, one candidate said he worked a lot with Maven. Eventually, he was asked to write a `pom.xml` file from scratch.
    - **DO NOT** talk * too much * about previous languages outside of these 10 weeks you've worked with briefly (like R or Python, for example), because they will turn the interview into an R or Python interview (unless you want to steer the interview in that direction).
