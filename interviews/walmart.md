## Coding Problems (in Java only)

- Given an input string such as "Welcome to Walmart e-Commerce" write code using Java to reverse the letter of each word while keeping the position of the word in the string using a recursive method. (Expected output: "emocleW ot tramlaW ecremmoC-e")

- Given an array of numbers such as [12, 345, 121, 67, 786, 9] write code using Java to sort them using [mergeSort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/).

- [Sort an array](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-sort-an-array-in-java)

- [Recursively reverse a String](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-string-using-recursion/)

- [Merge 2 lists](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/arraylist/merge-arraylists/)

## Behavioral Questions
