# Project-2 Requirements
Within groups, you are required to develop an full-stack web application using the following technologies.

#### Presentation Date: Tuesday July 19th, 2022
You will present this application as if you were pitching it to a board or to investors.
When you're presenting, you're welcome to provide a brief slideshow demonstrating the technologies involved in the app, it's features, and the Agile Development Process you underwent to develop it.

## ⁉️ ⁉️ What's Due Friday July 8th by 10am? ⁉️ ⁉️
- **Project Proposal** - you're welcome to use the word document provided in this directory or make a copy of [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2UKzwIcsxWdGlY5bIsM6XfOyx2NAPiL0VXWOLcLTkk/edit?usp=sharing)

  > Team Lead should slack this document to me.  The proposal is a brief description of your application.
  > The *Team Lead* represents the point of contact for the team and will be reporting updates in occasional all-hands standup.

## Agile Scrum Guidelines
For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.

- Every day you should have a stand-up meeeting with your team.
- Elect a Leader within your team who will represent the main point of contact & assist in task mgmt.

<br>

### In your Team Standups Use the 3 question agenda:
*Team Lead asks each attendee to answer these questions.*

  1. *What have I done since the last meeting?*
  2. *What do I plan to complete before the next meeting*
  3. *What problems am I likely to face?*


*Don’t spend too much time on status updates. Focus on what needs to be done and the problems or impediments that may arise.*
> Of course, your team is responsible for holding additional planning and collaboration meetings -- stand-ups are simply a check-in.

## Suggestions:
- Use a [Kanban Board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) like [Trello](https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=437184392320&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOfgZifIwr-ClvNLXs4m9zn7VFhTU4bXoVdq1iBVe7SNfiXGeVVNKlgaAsHAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
