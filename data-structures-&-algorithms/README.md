# Data Structures & Algorithms
Knowledge of data structures like Hash Tables, Lists, Queues, Graphs, and various algorithms goes a long way in solving engineering problems efficiently.  Interviewers are often interested in seeing how candidates use these tools to solve a problem. 

Just like a car mechanic needs the right tool to fix a car and make it run properly, a programmer needs the right tool (algorithm and data structure) to make the software run properly, making it efficient and scalable.
