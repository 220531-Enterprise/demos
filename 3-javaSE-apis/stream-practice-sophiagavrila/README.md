# Java Stream API Practice Problems
A set of 9 Stream practice problems. *This challange is not graded, but is intended to help you prepare for interview Stream questions*.

> Clone this repository onto your machine. <br>
> Open the project in your IDE: `File` > `Open Projects From File System` > `Directory` > Click on the project folder that you cloned (*i.e* `stream-practice-yourUsername`)<br>

1. Navigate to the package `com.revature.challenge`.  In that package there is a class called `StreamTest.java`.

2. In `StreamTest.java` you'll notice that in lines `24` - `42`There are a few objects created along with an ArrayList.  **Your challenge is to perform operations using the `Stream` API**.

3. Each question asks you to fetch and/or transform a particular object in the source collection, an ArrayList called `students`. (:exclamation: Remember that operations on a stream produce a **result**, but **do NOT modify its underlying data structure**). 

4. In each question 1-9, perform a series of stream operations on the `students` list and print the result to the console.

  > Only modify the `StreamTest.java` file!
